## 1. Alerts

An alert is a box that pops up to give the user a message.

```javascript
alert("Thanks for yout input!");
```

Alert is a keywordâ€”that is, a word that has special meaning for JavaScript. It means, "Display, in an alert box, the message that follows." Note that alert isn't capitalized.

***A semicolon isn't always necessary, but it's easier to end every statement with a semicolon, rather than stop to figure out whether you need one.***

## 2. Variables for Strings

```js
var name = "Mark"
name = "Ace"
```

## 3. Variables for Numbers

```javascript
var weight = 150;
```

## 8. Concatenating text strings

```javascript
var userName = "kim";
alert("Thanks, " + userName + "!");
```

## 9. Prompts

***A prompt box asks the user for some information and provides a response field for her answer.***

This code asks the user the question "Your species?" and ***provides a default answer in the response field, "human".*** She can change the response. Whether she leaves the default response as-is or changes it to something else, her response is assigned to the variable.

```c++
var spec = prompt("Your species?", "human");
var numberOfCats = prompt("How many cats?");
var tooManyCats = numberOfCats + 1;
```

But no such luck. ***All responses to prompts come back as strings.*** When the string, "3", is linked with a plus to the number, 1, JavaScript converts the 1 to a string and concatenates. So the value of tooManyCats winds up being not 4 but "31".
